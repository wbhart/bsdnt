This directory holds files that contain assembler and other code that is 
specific to particular architectures.  In general the type of the file
is set by its extension and its specific function is set by its name in 
a way that will now be described.  

1. Usage
========

The C source code for low level functions make use of defines of the form:

HAVE_ARCH_<bsdnt_function>

for each bsdnt_function they implement (angle brackets <> will be used to
indicate where such names appear in symbols as shown above).  If such a 
symbol is defined it mmeans that the function in question has a faster 
version defined within the arch directory that should be used instead. 

Hence, for example, the existence of the define:

  HAVE_ARCH_nn_add_mc

will mean that the C function calleld nn_add_mc in the generic C source 
code will be excluded when the file it is in is compiled. 
 
To achieve this exclusion, the generic C file <bsd_function_category>.c 
expects to find a file <bsd_function_category>_arch.h at root level in 
the arch directory that contains all the HAVE_ARCH_<bsdnt_function> 
defines for the architecture  that is being built.  Hence, for example, 
the file implementing the linear arithmetic functions:

  nn_linear.c 

will expect to find the file:

  nn_linear_arch.h

at root level in the arch directory having defines for all the files that
are to be excluded when it is compiled.  It is the responsibility of the 
build system for the architecture in question to create or copy such a 
file into this location before the build is started.

2. Architeture Specific Files
=============================

Files specific to each architecture are all placed in the arch directory
and are distinguished by file naming conventions. The naming convention
adopted is:

  <bsdnt_function_category>_<operating system>_<cpu type>.(c|h|asm)
  
The operating system categories so far identified are:

  x86      32-bit *nix systems 
  x86_64   64-bit *nix systems
  win32    32-bit Windows systems
  x64      64-bit Windows systems

So, for example, these files are 

nn_linear_x86_core2.h
nn_linear_x86_64_core2.h
nn_linear_win32_core2.h
nn_linear_x64_core2.h

and:

nn_linear_x86_core2.as
nn_linear_x86_64_core2.as
nn_linear_win32_core2.asm
nn_linear_x64_core2.asm

are the header and assembler files holding assembler implemntations of
the linear aritmetic functions for x86 and x86_64 on *nix and for win32
and x64 on Windows.

The assembler does not have to implement all functions and, if the 
header files hold inline assembler, the assembler files might not be
present.
